# Why not hadoop?  
**1.Batch Processing**: Hadoop and MapReduce are designed for batch processing, making them unfit for real-time 
or near real-time processing such as streaming data.  
**2. Complexity**: Hadoop has a steep learning curve and its setup, configuration, and maintenance can be complex 
and time-consuming.  
**3. Data Movement**: Hadoop's architecture can lead to inefficiencies and network congestion when dealing with 
smaller data sets.  
**4. Fault Tolerance**: While Hadoop has data replication for fault tolerance, it can lead to inefficient storage use and 
doesn't cover application-level failures.  
**5. No Support for Interactive Processing**: MapReduce doesn't support interactive processing, making it unsuitable 
for tasks needing back-and-forth communication.  
**6. Not Optimal for Small Files**: Hadoop is less effective with many small files, as it's designed to handle large data 
files.  

**In most real-world scenarios, Spark is 10–100x faster than traditional Hadoop MapReduce.**

# What is apache spark?
Apache Spark is an open-source tool used to process large amounts of data quickly. It works across many computers at once, making it great for big data tasks.

It’s fast, easy to use, and supports many different use cases — like:

1. Processing data in batches (like daily reports)

2. Handling live data streams (like website activity)

3. Running machine learning models

4. Running queries to explore data interactively

It also handles failures automatically and makes working with large datasets much easier.

**SPARK DOES NOT HAVE DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH IT CAN READ AND WRITE TO DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEMS**

# Features Of Spark
**1. Speed**: Compared to Hadoop MapReduce, Spark can execute large-scale data processing up to 100 times faster. 
This speed is achieved by leveraging controlled partitioning.  
**2. Powerful Caching** : Spark's user-friendly programming layer delivers impressive caching and disk persistence 
capabilities.  
**3. Deployment**: Spark offers versatile deployment options, including through Mesos, Hadoop via YARN, or its own 
cluster manager.  
**4. Real-Time Processing**: Thanks to in-memory computation, Spark facilitates real-time computation and offers low 
latency.  
**5. Polyglot**: Spark provides high-level APIs in several languages - Java, Scala, Python, and R, allowing code to be 
written in any of these. It also offers a shell in Scala and Python.  
**6. Scalability**: Spark's design is inherently scalable, capable of handling and processing large amounts of data by 
distributing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster.  

**Reson for Spark being so fast is IN MEMORY COMPUTATION**

# Spark Ecosystem
# Apache Spark Ecosystem Overview

Apache Spark is a powerful distributed processing engine designed for large-scale data processing. Below, the ecosystem is broken down into five core areas: Languages, Libraries, Engine, Management, and Storage.

---

## 1. Languages

Spark supports multiple programming languages to make it accessible to different types of developers:

- **Python (PySpark)**: Most widely used for data science and scripting.
- **Scala**: Native language for Spark; offers performance and tight integration.
- **Java**: Good for enterprise applications.
- **R**: Useful for statistical computing.
- **SQL**: Available through Spark SQL for analysts and engineers who prefer declarative syntax.

---

## 2. Libraries (High-Level APIs)

These are components built on top of Spark Core to handle specific data tasks:

- **Spark SQL**: For querying structured data using SQL or DataFrame API.
- **Structured Streaming**: Real-time data processing with event time support and end-to-end exactly-once guarantees.
- **MLlib**: Scalable machine learning algorithms including classification, regression, clustering, and pipelines.
- **GraphX**: Graph processing engine for analytics like PageRank, shortest paths, etc.
- **Delta Lake (external)**: Adds ACID transactions and schema enforcement on big data lakes.
- **Koalas / Pandas API on Spark**: Write pandas-like code with a Spark backend, enabling easier migration from pandas to Spark.

---

## 3. Engine

At its core, Spark has a powerful engine that optimizes data processing:

- **Spark Core**: Manages task scheduling, memory management, fault tolerance, and job execution.
- **Catalyst Optimizer**: Optimizes queries written in Spark SQL.
- **Tungsten Execution Engine**: Optimizes physical execution of Spark jobs using whole-stage code generation and memory management.

---

## 4. Management / Orchestration

These tools help submit, monitor, and orchestrate Spark jobs:

- **Cluster Managers**:
  - **YARN**
  - **Kubernetes**
  - **Apache Mesos**
- **Orchestration Tools**:
  - **Apache Airflow**: Popular for scheduling workflows and DAGs.
  - **Apache Oozie**, **Dagster**: Other orchestration options.
- **Managed Services**:
  - **Databricks**: Commercial managed Spark platform with notebooks and built-in optimizations.
- **Apache Livy**: REST API for submitting Spark jobs remotely.

---

## 5. Storage / Data Sources

Spark connects to various storage and data systems:

- **Distributed File Systems**:
  - HDFS, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob
- **Relational Databases**:
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Hive
- **File Formats**:
  - Parquet, ORC, Avro, JSON, CSV
- **Streaming Sources**:
  - Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Flume

Spark abstracts all these using its unified **DataSource API**, allowing seamless switching between storage systems.
