## üîÑ High-Level Flow of Spark Job Execution

When you run a Spark job, here's what happens under the hood:

---

### 1. **Driver Program Starts**
- Your application starts with the **Driver**.
- The driver creates a **SparkContext** (or `SparkSession` in Spark 2.x+).
- This is the main entry point and coordinator.

---

### 2. **Logical Plan Creation**
- Spark parses your transformations (`filter`, `select`, `groupBy`, etc.) into a **Logical Plan**.
- It's an abstract representation ‚Äî like a recipe.

---

### 3. **Optimization with Catalyst**
- Spark uses the **Catalyst Optimizer** to optimize the logical plan:
  - Removes unnecessary operations
  - Reorders filters
  - Applies pushdown optimizations
- Output: an **Optimized Logical Plan**

---

### 4. **Physical Plan Generation**
- Spark generates multiple **physical plans** and selects the most efficient one based on **cost model**.
- A physical plan contains **RDDs**, **stages**, and **tasks**.

---

### 5. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Formation**
- The chosen plan is converted into a **DAG of stages**.
- Each **Stage** is a set of **Tasks** that can run in parallel.
- Spark breaks down the job into **narrow** and **wide** dependencies.

---

### 6. **Stage and Task Scheduling**
- **DAGScheduler**:
  - Divides the job into **stages** based on shuffle boundaries.
- **TaskScheduler**:
  - Launches **tasks** in those stages on the available **executors**.

---

### 7. **Execution on Executors**
- Each **Executor** runs multiple **tasks** in parallel using allocated cores.
- Executors:
  - Execute code
  - Store shuffle data
  - Cache RDDs (if `persist()` or `cache()` is used)

---

### 8. **Shuffles & Wide Transformations**
- A **shuffle** happens when data needs to move between partitions (e.g., `groupByKey`, `join`).
- Shuffle data is written to disk and read across nodes.

---

### 9. **Task Completion**
- Once all tasks in a stage are complete:
  - Spark moves to the next stage.
  - This continues until the final **action** (`count`, `collect`, etc.) is complete.

---

### 10. **Result Returned to Driver**
- For actions like `collect()`, data is sent back to the **Driver**.
- For actions like `write()`, results are written to external storage (e.g., HDFS, S3, Delta).

| Component        | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Driver**        | Main control program. Coordinates all stages and tasks.             |
| **DAGScheduler**  | Splits job into stages based on shuffle boundaries.                 |
| **TaskScheduler** | Schedules tasks to executor slots.                                  |
| **Executors**     | Perform the actual work ‚Äî compute tasks and return results.         |
| **BlockManager**  | Caches/shuffles data between executors.                             |
| **ShuffleManager**| Handles data movement during shuffles.                              |

## üìÅ Cluster Manager

| Component         | Location       | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster Manager**| External Service | Allocates resources across worker nodes, launches executors          |

### Cluster Manager Responsibilities
- Accepts resource requests from the Driver
- Allocates nodes and launches Executors
- Can be:
  - **Standalone** (Spark's built-in)
  - **YARN** (Hadoop)
  - **Kubernetes** (containers)
