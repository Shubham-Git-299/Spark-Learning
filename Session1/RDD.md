# RDD in Spark

**RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)** are the foundational data structure in Apache Spark. They enable distributed, fault-tolerant, and efficient computation over large-scale datasets. Here's an in-depth breakdown:

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is RDD?
**RDD** stands for:
- **Resilient**: Fault-tolerant and capable of rebuilding data in case of node failure.
- **Distributed**: Data is spread across multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **Dataset**: A collection of partitioned data, each containing values.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Properties of RDDs

1. **Fundamental Data Structure**  
   RDD is the core abstraction in Spark, designed to enable parallel operations on massive datasets.

2. **Immutability**  
   Once an RDD is created, it cannot be modified. Every transformation on an RDD produces a new RDD, leaving the original intact.

3. **Resilience**  
   Fault tolerance is built-in. If a node fails, the RDD can recover lost data using the **lineage** â€” a record of all transformations used to build the dataset.

4. **Lazy Evaluation**  
   Transformations on RDDs (like `map`, `filter`) are not executed immediately. They're computed only when an **action** (like `count`, `collect`) is invoked. This allows Spark to optimize the computation.

5. **Partitioning**  
   RDDs are automatically partitioned across the nodes in the Spark cluster, enabling distributed and parallel computation.

6. **In-Memory Computation**  
   RDDs can reside in memory across nodes, allowing for faster access during repeated operations. This drastically reduces disk I/O.

7. **Distributed Nature**  
   RDDs are processed in parallel across the cluster, enhancing performance and scalability.

8. **Persistence**  
   RDDs can be **cached** or **persisted** in memory or on disk. This is useful for iterative algorithms like those used in machine learning.

9. **Operations**  
   RDDs support two types of operations:
   - **Transformations**: Lazy operations like `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `groupByKey`, etc., that return a new RDD.
   - **Actions**: Operations like `count`, `collect`, `saveAsTextFile`, which trigger execution and return values or output.

> RDDs offer fine-grained control over distributed data processing and are ideal for lower-level transformations and custom processing logic.
