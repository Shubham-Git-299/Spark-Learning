# 📦 Spark Partitioning, Tasks, and Cores — Explained with Example

## 🎯 Scenario:
You're reading **1 GB of data** from **Hadoop HDFS** into a **Spark** job with the following setup:

- HDFS Block Size: **128 MB** (default)
- Spark Worker Nodes: **3**
- Cores per Worker: **4** (Total = 12 cores)

---

## 🔢 How Spark Handles It

### 1. 🧹 Number of Partitions

Spark by default creates **one partition per HDFS block**.

- 1 GB / 128 MB = **8 HDFS blocks**
- ➔ **8 partitions** will be created in Spark

```
1 GB file → 8 HDFS blocks → 8 Spark partitions
```

---

### 2. ⚙️ Number of Tasks

Spark creates **1 task per partition** per stage.

- So, for reading the file (first stage):
  - ➔ **8 tasks**

> In later stages (transformations, joins, etc.), Spark might create more or fewer tasks based on operations.

---

### 3. 🧠 Number of Cores

- Each of the 3 worker nodes has 4 cores:
  - 3 workers × 4 cores = **12 cores available**

- Since there are **8 tasks**:
  - Spark will run **all 8 in parallel** using up to 8 of the 12 cores.

## 📊 Summary Table

| Element            | Value                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Input Size         | 1 GB                         |
| HDFS Block Size    | 128 MB                       |
| Partitions Created | 8                            |
| Tasks Created      | 8 (in first stage)           |
| Cores Available    | 12 (3 workers × 4 cores)     |
| Parallel Tasks     | 8 (at this stage)            |

## 🧠 Bonus Tips

- Check partition count:
  ```python
  df.rdd.getNumPartitions()
  ```
- Repartition data:
  ```python
  df = df.repartition(20)  # creates 20 partitions → 20 tasks in next stage
  ```
- Coalesce to reduce partition count without full shuffle:
  ```python
  df = df.coalesce(4)
  ```
- Rule of thumb: **2 to 4 partitions per CPU core** for optimal performance

---

## 📌 TL;DR
> Spark partitions data based on HDFS blocks, executes one task per partition, and runs tasks in parallel depending on available cores.

Efficient partitioning = faster jobs + better resource usage!

## 🤔 Interview-Worthy Example: Shuffle with Wide Transformation

### Question:
You have a dataset with user transaction logs. You perform a groupBy on `user_id`. What happens in terms of partitioning and tasks?

### Answer:
- A `groupBy("user_id")` is a **wide transformation** that causes a **shuffle**.
- Spark will redistribute data across nodes so that all records with the same `user_id` go to the **same partition**.
- This results in a new stage and a new set of **tasks**.

#### Let's say:
- The dataset had **20 partitions before groupBy**
- Spark **shuffles** the data and creates **20 new partitions**
- ➔ **20 shuffle read tasks** are executed in the next stage

> You can reduce shuffle overhead by using techniques like `partitionBy` during writes or `salting` to avoid skew.

This kind of example shows your understanding of **Spark internals** and **real-world tuning** in interviews!
